## What is quality assurance (QA)? (Gillis, 2024)

Quality assurance helps a company create products and services that meet the needs, expectations and requirements of customers. It yields high-quality product offerings that build trust and loyalty with customers. The standards and procedures defined by a quality assurance program help prevent product defects before they arise.

## When Do You Use QA Automation in Testing? (Testlio, 2024)

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipelines: In CI/CD pipelines, automated tests are integrated into the development process to provide immediate feedback on new changes. This helps ensure new code does not break existing functionality and maintains the overall quality of the software.

## Types of Software Tests That Can Be Automated (Testlio, 2024)

Ideal candidates for automation are repeatable, reusable, and stable test cases with high pass rates. Below are the key types of software tests suitable for automation:

- **Unit Tests**

  - **Purpose:** Verify individual components or functions.

  - **Benefits:** Enable early detection and quick resolution of errors, improving code quality and reducing long-term costs.

- **Integration Tests**

  - **Purpose:** Examine interactions between different components or systems.
  - **Benefits:** Detect issues related to data flow, communication, and dependencies, ensuring seamless operation of integrated parts and reducing integration-related bugs in production.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**

  - **Purpose:** Simulate real user scenarios to validate the complete application workflow from start to finish.
  - **Benefits:** Ensure comprehensive coverage of user interactions. While often a mix of manual and automated testing is used due to complexity, automation can still significantly enhance coverage and reliability.

- **Regression Tests**

  - **Purpose:** Confirm that recent code changes haven't negatively impacted existing functionalities.

  - **Benefits:** Automatically check the entire application after updates, preventing the introduction of new bugs.

- **Performance Tests**

  - **Purpose:** Assess software performance under different conditions such as load, stress, and scalability.

  - **Benefits:** Provide consistent measurements of response time, speed, and reliability, facilitating quick identification and resolution of efficiency issues.
