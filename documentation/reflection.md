# Compare and contrast the different types and levels of verification (analysis, demonstration, test, formal proof, inspection etc.) and testing (unit, integration, systems, and acceptance) including the role and value of test driven development techniques.

To fulfill this Learning Outcome, I researched various **types and levels of verification [] and testing [], including the role and value of Test-Driven Development (TDD) [] LO2.5.2.5**. I also **compared and contrasted** these different concepts and, more importantly, applied them in practice. To demonstrate my understanding of Unit, Integration, and End-to-End testing, I developed a Todo list web application [add respository] and implemented tests for it. In order to ensure a multidisciplinary approach and stay current with modern practices, I incorporated server actions to connect with the database, making the project full-stack and closer to a real-world environment. Unit testing was used to ensure individual functions worked as intended by isolating them from external dependencies through mocking[add file]. Integration testing verified the interaction between components, such as the function and the database, ensuring they worked together as expected[add file]. Lastly, End-to-End testing simulated user interactions and validated the functionality of the entire application across multiple interconnected components[add file].

I felt a strong motivation to dive deeper into testing, as it's an area I recognize could be significantly improved at work. However, I was also cautious about dedicating too much time to framework-specific tools, as my previous experience—spending holidays learning a testing framework for Java that I’ve never used again—was somewhat discouraging. In the end, the experience was insightful and gave me an understanding of testing within the technologies I work with.

The fundamental concepts of Unit, Integration, and End-to-End testing remain consistent with the knowledge I had previously acquired. However, I noticed an increase in the complexity of implementing these tests, largely due to the multitude of libraries and frameworks now commonly integrated into modern web applications. This added complexity led to several troubleshooting sessions, highlighting the technical challenges involved. This exercise also reinforced my understanding of the need for thorough testing and the importance of being able to refactor code with confidence. Another interesting takeaway was revisiting the topic of Test-Driven Development (TDD). While it’s widely discussed in the software community, I have yet to meet a developer who applies TDD consistently in daily work. Overall, the importance and benefits of testing are undeniable; however, in real-world environments, especially in non-software companies, IT teams are often pressured to deliver results quickly. This leads to technical debt in the medium and long term as testing and code quality are often deprioritized.

Looking ahead, I aim to incorporate more testing practices into the applications I develop and seek professional opportunities where I can deepen my experience with testing methodologies. I plan to apply the knowledge gained and reinforced through this Learning Outcome to ensure that my future projects maintain high-quality standards. By integrating testing more consistently, I hope to improve both the reliability and maintainability of my code, allowing for more confident development and refactoring in the long term.
