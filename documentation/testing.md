Testing

(Bao, 2024)

## Unit Testing

Individual code units (functions, methods, classes) are isolated and tested independently. This testing level focuses on verifying each unit's internal logic and functionality to ensure they operate as expected.

## Integration Testing

Integration testing verifies how individual software components (modules) work together after being unit-tested. It focuses on ensuring individual software pieces. In this level of testing, two or more unit-tested modules are integrated to test technique-interacting components.

## System Testing

System testing is a comprehensive evaluation of a software system's overall functionality and performance. It ensures that the entire system meets the development criteria. This level of testing is critical for detecting system-wide issues such as compatibility problems, performance bottlenecks, and security weaknesses.

## Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing is the final stage of software testing, which ensures the software functions properly in the user's working environment. It determines whether the software fits the business requirements and user acceptance criteria as expected or not.

Unlike earlier testing levels, acceptance testing assesses the system from the user's perspective, not the technical functionality.

## Summary

| **Testing Type**        | **Level**     | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Scope**                                          | **Focus**                                                    | **Performed By**                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Unit Testing**        | Lowest Level  | Verify individual code units (functions, methods, classes) for correctness. | Isolated units of code.                            | Internal logic and functionality.                            | Developers                       |
| **Integration Testing** | Middle Level  | Ensure that combined modules or components work together as intended.       | Interaction between multiple units or modules.     | Interfaces and data flow between components.                 | Developers and QA Engineers      |
| **System Testing**      | Higher Level  | Validate the complete and integrated software system against requirements.  | Entire system as a whole.                          | Overall functionality, performance, compatibility, security. | QA Engineers                     |
| **Acceptance Testing**  | Highest Level | Confirm the software meets business requirements and is ready for use.      | End-to-end user scenarios in the user environment. | User experience and business needs.                          | End Users, Clients, QA Engineers |
